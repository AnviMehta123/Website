<p><B>Customer satisfaction matters most to us. Our client reviews reflect our commitment and dedication to deliver the best services.</B>
<p>We booked a day tour to Taj Mahal from India Tours. The tour was very convenient. The driver was on time. He was polite and professional. We saw Taj Mahal and Red Fort. He took us to a good restaurant where we had lunch, before we went chopping at market nearby and started back to Delhi. We reached back in evening. It was a great trip. Will certainly recommend India Tours to everyone. <B>George Michael.</B></p>

<p>Our 16 days tour of Kerala was flawlessly managed by India Tours. From pick up till drop back to the airport, the tour plan was micro managed beautifully. Our driver, Ramesh was very nice. He made travel entertaining. Parveen, the manager, was in touch with us on daily basis. He booked the best house boat for us and even arranged a guide to show us around. It was a big help.  We had a great time. Kids loved it too. Many thanks to Parveen, Ramesh and all India Tours team for a great holiday. <B>Julia Roberts</B></p>
<p>Had the opportunity to use Indus Trips again for a photo workshop in Myanmar in January 2019. Owner Parveen Kumar provided exceptional service with the choice of hotels and restaurants. He arranged for some unique photo opportunities - much appreciated by our group. <B>Katrina Kaif</B></p>
<p>My parents wanted to visit Char Dham and I wanted a comfortable tour for them. Parveen from India Tours explained the tour plan in details, shared complete list of hotels, amenities with me along with the cost. He got an Innova for the trip and arranged a guide to assist my parents all through the tour. My parents had a very comfortable experience and they were well taken care of in every way. Parveen even arranged extra blankets for them during travel. I have never seen such level of service excellence. India Tours in the BEST! Thank You! <B>Abhishek Bachhan</B></p>
